# Legislator Photos

Sunlight Foundation provides zip files of official photos of members of Congress,
as taken from the Congressional Pictorial Directory. We offer them in 3 sizes,
and the files are all named using the memberâ€™s Bioguide ID.

* [Small, 40x50](http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/moc/40x50.zip)
* [Medium, 100x125](http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/moc/100x125.zip)
* [Large, 200x250](http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/moc/200x250.zip)

## Requirements

* Node.js
* Grunt - `npm install -g grunt-cli`

## Installation

Install the required NPM packages:

    npm install

## Usage

The task will download the zip files from sunlightfoundation.com, unzip them,
and build them for distribution.

    grunt

The photos will be built in the `dist/` directory, and can be deployed to
a static server in production.

### Details

If you just want to download the photos without building anything:

    grunt fetch

You will find all of the image files in `tmp/src`.

If you want to repeat the build process but skip downloading all the files,
then run:

    grunt build

After building you can refresh the `dist/` directory:

    grunt dist

### Packaging

To package a release for Bower instead, use the `release` task after
fetching and building:

    grunt release

The package will be available in the `build/release` directory.

### Black and White

To make all the photos black and white, run the following commands:

    grunt fetch
    grunt build
    ./Grayscale.sh
    grunt dist

The script requires you to have ImageMagick installed. Also check that the
`Grayscale.sh` script is executable.
